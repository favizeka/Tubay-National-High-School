  <p>Everyone is invited to join this year's school maintenance week, Early Brigada Eskwela 2024-2025, Brigada Eskwela will start on January 27 until February 23, 2024.

   We hope that you take this opportunity to support this program, as your donation will do so much for our school and most of all for our students. This will surely benefit not just the school community but also the community that our school envisions to shape.

  This day holds more significance because it comes at a time when the Philippine education system is undergoing the biggest education reform in the country, the K to 12 Program. 
    For us in the schools, may this theme remind us of the core reason of our vocation: to mold young minds into citizens who have a heart for service and a dream for the Filipino nation.

    <p>Developing a before/after school intramural program or activity club for students is a great way to provide resources and exposure to new sports, activities and games. It also creates a sense of belonging to the school environment, and connection with teachers and peers outside the classroom. Activities may include friendly competitions in various sports like basketball, volleyball, badminton, and can be based on student choice, development of specific skills or to prepare for fitness testing. </p>
